Trying Something New.

Introducing TSSM

Arrival of the New Titan Magazine is finally here! Templeton’s very own magazine! Filled with columns to help the everyday-Titan navigate school and all that comes with it. This magazine will present news columns as an outlet to catch up on monthly events, activities, and student council announcements, and to provide knowledge about Templeton clubs and sports games. We’ll also have monthly pieces of art works in the form of, comics, an art gallery, and story telling. We are open to any student or member of faculty that want their voice to be heard.

According to a small poll conducted by the magazine, 2 out of 3 people would prefer to read the magazine as a hard copy. The magazine has taken this into consideration, but for the first publication the magazine will be available only online. A decision for the second publication will be founded on the outcome of the first. The magazine urges Titans to voice their suggestions so that this can be easy and fun to read. The Templeton Secondary School Magazine team would be undoubtedly appreciative if its readers gave feedback of any sort. Whether it is about the want for a hard copy, or the idea of more news coverage on a school event, anything at all. All comments are valid and appreciated. If any Templeton students think they may want to join the TSSM team they are encouraged to contact the magazine editors Eldrich Lucero or Mateya Burney. (You can also contact us via emailing templetonmagazine@gmail.com)The TSSM team wants to be able to knit the Templeton student network closer than ever with this definitive news outlet. The team is excited to bring all aspects of this great school together and create a basic communication platform for all students.

On October 6th, Templeton’s Active For Life PE class went on their first recreational field trip to Deep Cove located in North Van. We hiked the Baden Powell Trail, which leads to Quarry Rock, that offers scenic views of the Indian Arm. ![https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/600/1*OQKkTzqe5xeKahHG2KLdIg.jpeg](export/assets/httpscdn-images-1mediumcommax.jpeg) This is a great hike for beginners who want to challenge themselves. Those who find it easy can increase their speed as they go up and they’ll be guaranteed to work up a sweat. The round trip is 3.8 km with a 100 m elevation gain. Our PE class went right after lunch, so it was really busy. Then, about 10 minutes in, we got hit by the pouring rain. But in a way, the rain made it easier to climb because the air was a lot cooler. The trip was a nice break from the usual routine that we all face at school. By doing the hike, we did even more exercise than we would have if we were to have done a campus run at school. Also, being surrounded by nature definitely beats the average PE class that you would encounter on a daily basis. Ms. Inch, our PE teacher, talked about how it’s so important to take advantage of the nature around us, especially since we live in Vancouver. There are beaches, mountains and forests all around us. I definitely recommend this hike since it is one that you can do with friends, family and you can even bring your dog with you. It’s a great way to get your daily exercise requirements, and it’s a great way to enjoy everything nature provides us with.
