On October 6th, Templeton’s Active For Life PE class went on their first recreational field trip to Deep Cove located in North Van. We hiked the Baden Powell Trail, which leads to Quarry Rock, that offers scenic views of the Indian Arm.  ![](/assets/fit-for-life-deep-cove.jpg)

This is a, great hike for beginners who want to challenge themselves. Those who find it easy can increase their speed as they go up and they’ll be guaranteed to work up a sweat. The round trip is 3.8 km with a 100 m elevation gain. Our PE class went right after lunch, so it was really busy. Then, about 10 minutes in, we got hit by the pouring rain. But in a way, the rain made it easier to climb because the air was a lot cooler. The trip was a nice break from the usual routine that we all face at school. By doing the hike, we did even more exercise than we would have if we were to have done a campus run at school. Also, being surrounded by nature definitely beats the average PE class that you would encounter on a daily basis. Ms. Inch, our PE teacher, talked about how it’s so important to take advantage of the nature around us, especially since we live in Vancouver. There are beaches, mountains and forests all around us. I definitely recommend this hike since it is one that you can do with friends, family and you can even bring your dog with you. It’s a great way to get your daily exercise requirements, and it’s a great way to enjoy everything nature provides us with.
