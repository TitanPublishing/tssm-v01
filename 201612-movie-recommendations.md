<p class="firstBold"><span id="firstBold">As a student here at Templeton Secondary</span>, I admit things are hectic as we approach the colder months. With the holidays coming up, we face the end of term one, which means assignments are due and finals are near. When things get busy, I, like all of you, have less spare time. I’m a working student at a movie theatre, where amazing movies of all genres are coming out this month, including <strong>Trolls</strong>, <strong>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</strong>, <strong>Arrival</strong> and more!
</p>
<p>One of the best of these is <strong>Arrival</strong>. I love anything regarding extraterrestrial life, and I encourage you all to go see it whenever you have time on your hands. It’s sold out almost every show for the past week! Similar to the <strong>X-Files</strong> from the 90’s, it’s about a linguistic professor named Louise Banks. With an incredible knowledge of language, she leads an entire elite team of investigators when enormous spaceships land in 12 locations around the world.
</p>
<p>If movies are not your thing, that’s alright! There are millions of things and hobbies you can be passionate about. Sometimes, we all need an outlet to relieve all the stress school, friends, family, etc. can cause. Whether it may be knitting, drawing, watching movies or simply writing in a journal, do whatever makes you happiest. We are all human.
