# Monthly Struggle: No Sprain No Gain
## Can I learn from my mistakes?

<div>
<p class="firstBold"><span id="firstBold">I’ve had this issue for a while.</span> There’s nothing worse than a sprained muscle. It’s honestly better to just break a bone because it’ll heal and you can eventually get back to whatever activities you were doing before. With a sprained muscle, you’re left with this false hope that your muscle is capable of activity again, but you eventually hurt it and make it worse. That’s what i’ve been dealing with for the past two months.

In December, I injured my calf during a basketball game. I sprained it (didn’t know you could sprain a calf muscle) and I was walking with a limp for a bit because I was in pain, which gradually dulled down over time. I thought I was fine to play, but I get shoved to the ground during the next game. I landed awkwardly on my calf and this shooting pain radiated throughout my leg. This pain was worse than the initial pain that I felt when I first injured the calf. I went through intense massage therapy and whatnot to nurse my calf back to health and just when I thought it had gotten better, I’d bump it funny and it would hurt again.

Not only am I incapable of doing physical activity with this sprain, I’m incapable of getting out of bed in the morning. When the weather is colder, my calf feels super painful and stiff. So, I’m often late for school because I simply cannot get out of bed. The worst part is that there’s not much more I can do for my leg. Now that basketball season is over, I’ll be able to rest it, but soccer requires me to dive onto my leg which results in a shooting pain going up my leg.

My teammates are great though, and recognize that I’m injured and step up to try to relieve the strain on my leg. I’ve sprained my ankle before and, for the longest time, that ankle was way weaker than the other. So, I’m trying to avoid that imbalance by working each leg equally at the gym. So far, stretching out the calf relieves pain, but I have to be careful. Hopefully in the next few months, I’ll be able to use my calf, but it’s highly unlikely because I never learn from my past mistakes.
