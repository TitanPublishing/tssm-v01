<p class="firstBold"><span id="firstBold">I have problems. Napping is just one of them</span>, but a big one. Most of my teachers know this already but, for those that don’t, I tend to fall asleep in class a lot. It’s not because the class is boring or for lack of sleep, but if the teacher decides to put on a movie, there’s a 90% chance that I’m going to fall asleep.
</p>
<p>
This is so problematic. Sure, I get a good snooze in class and miss out on a boring movie, but what am I supposed to do when I have to write a review or essay on what I was supposed to watch? Unsurprisingly, I’ve been in this situation way too many times and all I can say is that Wikipedia is your best friend. Shout-out to whomever takes the time to write out the complete plot of movies.
</p>
<p>
Maybe I should try getting more sleep. Maybe I should try to keep myself occupied during movies so I don’t pass out. Don’t pull a Jasmine; get your sleep. The average teen needs about 7–9 hours of sleep and I’m sure you can get those hours outside of class time.
In English class, we have Hall Passes that you take with you when you want to go to the bathroom. Usually, there are two Hall Passes. Up until a week ago or so, there were two Hall Passes, but somehow one went missing. Maybe someone thought it looked nice and kept it? Maybe someone left it in the washroom and forgot to bring it back.
</p>
<p>
Before I continue, I’d just like to state that I have no business in keeping a Hall Pass despite what some of my classmates think. There’s absolutely no reason for me to take a Hall Pass. What am I supposed to do with a small card hanging from a lanyard? Hang it on my wall next to my other medals? No. Just no.
</p>
<div class="left column-image">

</div>
<p>
So, despite having no motive to steal a Hall Pass, there are those that thought it would be a good idea to tell our teacher that I stole the Hall Pass. It disappeared on Day 2 and there are two English classes on Day 2. Their logic appears to be that someone in the other Day 2 class stole it. When they realized that I am in the other Day 2 class and therefore must be the one to blame. Seems they even have a whole reasoned-out motivation for the theft. Apparently, I hoard Hall Passes in my room! This is news to me. I guess you find out something new about yourself every day.
</p>
<p>
Anyways, I walk into class and as soon as I sit down, the teacher calls my name. Usually, he just calls me by my first name, but not today; Today, he calls out both my first and last names. Right away, I know something is up. He recounts the story of how I stole the Hall Pass and of course I am completely confused. My classmates turn on me, saying “yeah she stole it,” while I’m sitting there, trying to plead my case.
</p>
<p>To my fellow classmates, I’d like to say that I didn’t steal the Hall Pass despite the accusations. And to whoever did steal the Hall Pass, I don’t know what you’re doing with it but could you please bring it back so I can clear my name? Thanks!!!
